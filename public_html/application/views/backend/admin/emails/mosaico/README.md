# Mosaico PHP Backend

This is a PHP backend for Mosaico

Mosaico can be found at https://github.com/voidlabs/mosaico

First, install and set up Mosaico.  Then install these files on top of the Mosaico installation.

## Dependencies

You do need to have Imagemagick support enabled in your PHP configuration.

This project also requires Premailer (http://premailer.dialect.ca/).  Premailer is used to inline the CSS styles.  If that service is ever taken down, we will have to find an alternate solution.  Or, if you have an alternate solution that does not require dependencies on a web service, feel free to contribute!

## New folders and files
```
config.php
```
At the top of this file are a few variables that you can adjust if necessary.

```
/dl/index.php
/dl/premailer.php
```
This is the PHP backend that handles downloading of the HTML email and also sending of the test email.  The premailer.php file came from here: https://gist.github.com/barock19/1591053

```
/img/index.php
/img/resize.php
```
This is the PHP backend that handles generating the placeholder images and also the resizing of images.

```
/upload/index.php
```
This is the PHP backend that handles image uploads and retrieving of a list of uploaded images.

## Modified files

```
editor.html
```
This example file has been slightly modified.

1) The leading slashes in the three paths to the back end (/dl, /img, and /upload) has been removed so that Mosaico can be used in subfolders and not have to be at the root.

2) Trailing slashes have been added to /dl and /upload to avoid 301 redirects which Mosaico does not handle well.  The /img backend path here does not need a trailing slash added because the Mosaico code already adds one when this is used.
